function t2 = find_t2(e0_k,e0_m,fe,t1,t3,peak)
% This function finds the value of t2, the time when the emisisons rate 
% peaks, such that the maximum radiative forcing pathway just meets the 
% radiative forcing ceiling. It finds t2 by repeatedly bisecting the range 
% 0 to 100, calculating the radiative forcing pathway each time, and 
% repeating until the error between the maximum radiative forcing and the 
% ceiling falls below some tolerance.
%
% INPUT:
% fe:   initial fractional rate of change in emissions (unitless)
% t1:   year when fe(t) begins to decline (years)
% peak: the radiative forcing cieling (W/m^2)
% t3:   -1/min[fe(t)] (unitless)
% e0:   initial emissions (GtC)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% t2:   time from t1 until emissions stabilization [fe(t)=0] (years)
